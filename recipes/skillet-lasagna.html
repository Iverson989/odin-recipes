      <li>½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>

      <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
      <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
